  <p align="justify">The Earth is protected from harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun by a layer of ozone molecules found in our stratosphere. 
This protective layer has been damaged and the ozone has been depleted as a result of the excessive release of chlorine and bromine from man-made compounds 
such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrobromofluorocarbons (HBFCs). As a result of this depletion, an ozone hole was formed, allowing UV rays to penetrate
 the Earth. An ozone hole is not a hole in the literal sense but is defined geographically as an area where the total ozone amount is less than 220 Dobson units 
which is a measurement of atmospheric ozone, specifically in the stratosphere. The unit is named after G.M.B. Dobson, one of the first scientists who studied 
atmospheric ozone.</p>

restrictions on the use of CFCs and HBFCs. This means that the amount of these ozone-depleting substances will continuously decrease in the 
years to come. The bad news is that it will not be until the end of the twenty-first century that most ozone depletion will be reversed and

    <div class="w3-container">
<div id="myDiv" style="text-indent:3cm;">
 <p align="justify" style="font-size: 15px;">
     Prof. Colin Price of Tel Aviv University's Department of Geophysical, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences, 
working alongside Ph.D. candidate Israel Silber, has discovered that the radio waves reflecting back to Earth from 
the ionosphere offer valuable news on climate change as well. Their research shows that the strength of radio signals 
on the ground is a reliable indicator of the temperature change above. Prof. Price and his team used simple radio 
antennae on the ground to measure radio waves broadcast by navigational transmitters around the globe, then compared 
information on the strength of these radio signals with data on temperature fluctuations in the upper atmosphere. 
They discovered that climate change in the upper atmosphere — caused by an abundance of greenhouse gases — may lead 
to greater absorption of radio waves. Weaker signals could therefore be indicative of greater climate change.
On the Earth's surface and in the lower atmosphere, an increase of greenhouse gases has a warming effect, the 
gases acting as a "blanket" and keeping heat from escaping from the Earth into space. But these gases, including 
carbon dioxide, are increasing in the upper atmosphere as well, where they have a cooling effect.
When cooled, the ionosphere contracts and descends into the atmosphere to where the air is denser – 
leading to higher absorption of radio waves, Prof. Price explains. By examining satellite-gathered data 
on the temperature in the upper atmosphere and comparing results to measurements of radio wave amplitudes 
collected on the ground, the researchers were able to uncover a clear correlation, consistent over time. As 
the upper atmosphere gets colder, radio signals lose their strength.

 <p align="justify" style="font-size: 15px;">Professor Colin Price and PhD candidate Israel Silber used radio antennae on the ground 
to measure radio signals around the globe. They discovered that there is a correlation between 
temperature fluctuations in the upper atmosphere and the varying strength of the radio signals.
The temperature fluctuations in the ionosphere have long been attributed to the proliferation of 
greenhouse gases on earth. Greenhouse gases act as a shield to escaping infrared radiation from Earth, 
resulting in warming temps. But in the upper atmosphere, the result is a cooling effect that causes the 
atmosphere to shrink, moving closer to the planet. It is believed that this process also affects the radio 
waves passing through the ionosphere.

 <p align="justify" style="font-size: 15px;">These waves are considered high-frequency radio waves and are mainly used for communication. 
They were mostly used for long-distance telephone calls before the introduction of optical fibers They 
are also used to send signals for cable television as well as video or audio feeds from production vans 
to broadcast stations. Microwaves release millions and millions of tons of carbon monoxide into the environment 
every year, a new study has shown. Microwaves are good for transmitting information from one place to another because
microwave energy can penetrate haze, light rain and snow, clouds, and smoke.

Shorter microwaves are used in remote sensing. These microwaves are used for radar like the doppler radar 
used in weather forecasts. Microwaves, used for radar, are just a few inches long. The Earth's atmosphere is 
transparent to some wavelengths of microwave radiation, but not to others. The longer wavelengths (waves more 
similar to radio waves) pass through the Earth's atmosphere more easily than the shorter wavelength microwaves. 
Microwave telescopes need to be large, but not as large as radio telescopes. It postulates that microwaves used 
by wireless, radar, mobile, and satellite systems create a constant wave bombardment that causes molecular friction 
leading to warming and erratic weather changes.</p>

      <p align="justify" class="w3-text-black" style="font-size: 15px;">An effective absorber of infrared radiation has a
 broader absorption profile, which means that it can absorb a wider spectrum of wavelengths. Infrared light
 lies between the visible and microwave portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Infrared light has a range 
of wavelengths, just like visible light has wavelengths that range from red light to violet. "Near infrared" 
light is closest in wavelength to visible light and "far infrared" is closer to the microwave region of the 
electromagnetic spectrum. The longer, far infrared wavelengths are about the size of a pin head and the shorter,
 near infrared ones are the size of cells, or are microscopic.
</p>

<p align="justify" class="w3-text-black" style="font-size: 15px;">Infrared means “below red” whereas they have a lower 
frequency than the red part of the visible light. We don’t see infrared radiation but we feel it as heat.
 Higher temperatures produce shorter infrared rays These are used in remote controls for television sets, 
burglar alarm systems, night vision cameras, and certain types of thermometers. Most computers, laptops, palmtops, 
and printers are equipped with infrared data association ports that enable us to transfer and print data without 
connecting them with cable.
</p>

	<img src="NC16.png" align="middle">

<p align="justify" class="w3-text-black" style="font-size: 15px;">The sun's visible wavelengths of radiation pass easily through 
the atmosphere and reach Earth. Approximately 51% of this sunlight is absorbed in Earth's surface by the land, water,
 and vegetation. Some of this energy is emitted back from the Earth's surface in the form of infrared radiation. 
Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (methane, carbon dioxide, etc.) let visible light pass through but absorb infrared 
light – causing the atmosphere to heat up. The warmer atmosphere emits more infrared light, which tends to be 
re-absorbed – perhaps many times – before the energy eventually returns to space.  Such increases cause extra infrared 
light absorption, further heating Earth above its typical temperature range (even as energy from the sun stays basically 
the same). In other words, the energy that gets to Earth has an even harder time leaving it, causing Earth’s average temperature
 to increase – producing global climate change.

  <p align="justify" style="font-size: 15px;">These are the electromagnetic radiations that can be seen by our naked eye. This part of the electromagnetic 
spectrum is aptly called ‘visible light’ The sequence of visible light from longest to shortest may be remembered 
by the acronym ROYGBIV: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet but in modern usage indigo is not 
usually distinguished as a separate color. The light that we can see with our eyes is just a small part of the 
full spectrum of light that occurs in nature. We call this the electromagnetic spectrum because the light is a 
composite of interacting electric and magnetic force fields. </p>

      <p align="justify" style="font-size: 15px;">The spectrum extends from low-energy microwaves and infrared light to the visible part 
of the spectrum (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet), and then to more energetic forms 
of light such as ultraviolet and x-rays. The temperature of an object is determined by a balance between 
incoming and outgoing energy. For the Earth, the incoming energy is the absorbed light from the Sun, and the 
outgoing energy is the infrared light the Earth radiates out to space. In the absence of an atmosphere with its 
Greenhouse Effect, that balance would lead to very cold temperatures – well below the freezing point of water.

  <p align="justify" style="font-size: 15px;">It is more popularly known as UV which has 3 different wavelengths: UVA, UVB, and UVC. It is almost 
completely absorbed by the atmosphere and does not reach the Earth’s surface. Scientists have divided the 
ultraviolet part of the spectrum into three regions: the near ultraviolet, the far ultraviolet, and the 
extreme ultraviolet. The three regions are distinguished by how energetic the ultraviolet radiation is, and 
by the "wavelength" of the ultraviolet light, which is related to energy. The near ultraviolet, abbreviated NUV, 
is the light closest to optical or visible light. The extreme ultraviolet, abbreviated EUV, is the ultraviolet 
light closest to X-rays, and is the most energetic of the three types. The far ultraviolet, abbreviated FUV, lies 
between the near and extreme ultraviolet regions. It is the least explored of the three regions.</p>

 <p align="justify" style="font-size: 15px;">Climate change may have indirectly influenced the levels of UV radiation in the past by altering the amounts 
of ozone, UV-absorbing tropospheric gases, aerosols, and clouds in the atmosphere. These influences will likely 
continue into the future. The combined direct or indirect effects of these climate change-related factors are likely 
to influence the levels of solar UV radiation in the future and modulate the effects of the projected recovery of ozone. 
This interaction, which depends on latitude and on the emissions of GHGs, increases the complexity of assessing the future 
levels of solar UV radiation at the Earth's surface.  </p></div>

including the sun, clouds of interstellar matter, and remnants of supernovae, are sources of gamma rays. These 
rays are highly penetrating because of their very short wavelengths. Gamma rays are given off by radioactive

pass through bones and teeth. This makes gamma rays very dangerous. They can destroy living cells, produce 
gene mutations, and cause cancer. Ironically, the deadly effects of gamma rays can be used to treat cancer. 
In this type of treatment, a medical device sends out focused gamma rays that target cancerous cells. The gamma 
rays kill the cells and destroy the cancer.

 <p align="justify" style="font-size: 15px;">Gamma-rays have the smallest wavelengths and the most energy of any other wave in the electromagnetic 
spectrum. These waves are generated by radioactive atoms and in nuclear explosions. Gamma-rays travel to 
us across vast distances of the universe, only to be absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere. Different wavelengths 
of light penetrate the Earth's atmosphere to different depths. Instruments aboard high-altitude balloons and 
satellites like the Compton Observatory provide our only view of the gamma-ray sky.</p>
